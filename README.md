## Three normal methods

## Mathtype

## Axmath
In fact,as a software, I think its capabilities is as same sa Mathtype. It is made in China and it is cheaper than Mathtype.You can try it and You'll find I was right.

If you have a **MacBook with M1 chip**, maybe it's the best way to enter math formulas by Axmath. I did this by installing it on a virtual machine(Parallel Desktop), It is amazing! It's so fast and effictive, I highly recommend this combination for everyoneÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅ

The interface is shown below, very clean and efficient:

## LaTeX
I am writing this article mainly to discuss the use of LaTeX in MS office.One small problem is that it seems that currently it can only be imported as an image. This means that changes have to be re-edited.(Maybe I'm just not very good at!)

This is due to the fact that I have just bought a Macbook Air with M1 chip.According to my writing needs, I need use MS office and type math formulas in it.

Actually,it takes me much time to find this method and it does works. Let me show you how to make it.

Before I do so, I would like to make it clear that the __Version__ of office and TeX Releases.

Due to website limitations, our videos cannot be uploaded in very high quality.
